# Summary

#Version 2.2 is out!!!!

You can find it here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3592064

I strongly recommend to not print version 1 or 2 but version 2.2.
It is stronger and easier to print.
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
20.3.2019 ######## Version 2 ##########################################

Beta of version 2 is out! Use the customizer to get your version 2 belt in any length:
Click on the "Open in Customizer" button, choose your length and click "create thing". 
Considere to make a small testprint first!
Use 4 perimeters

If you need full access to CAD files you can download them here: https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-print-models/fashion/belts/belt-single-print-mmu-design

Version 2 changes:
-z-hight: 40mm -> 37mm 
-more clearance at the hinge pins -> easier to print
-more material at the hinge pins -> hopefully more stable and easier to print

################## Version 1 ##########################################






Seeking for a nice weekend project I stumbled upon this belt:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:325458
When I saw this I figured wouldn't it be nice to have a belt which comes off the printer fully assembled?
It took more than a weekend but here we are and it works really well! With a better eye for colors and fashion than I have it might even look fancy.

Before you print the whole thing please test your material by printing test_print.stl
I had best results with Prusa PETG. Use 4 perimeters. I wear my first prototype since about beginning of november every day at home without problems* (it's orange... you can't wear this bright orange in public :P )
*Update: it broke today 13.1.2019 :| I need to make this more dureable 

The sca-punk color mod does not work because it weakens the hinges. If you know how to do it anyway, please let me know because I want that look :) 

Even the design was not inspired by any other design except of the belt by LeFabShop I want to point out that there have been similar designs before concerning the hinges. 
This is the first I was able to find. If you know an older one let me know.

files:
Belts:
Belt_komplett_900... .stl:  850-950mm
Belt_komplett_805.stl:      755-855mm not testprinted! but should be ok
Belt_komplett_995.stl:      945-1045mm not testprinted! but should be ok
Belt_komplett_1090.stl:    1040-1140mm not testprinted! but should be ok
Take a close look at the print preview of the not testprinted length before you print it. If you find anything suspicious let me know and I fix it.

Everything else:
Schnalle_blank-8.stl: buckle without logo 
Schnalle_3DW-8.stl: buckle with 3DW logo
test_print.stl: test print your settings and filament with it
color_mod: files I used to modify color
buckle_blank.stp: Step file, so you can edit the buckle on your CAD system (and e.g. add your logo)


2.2.2019
Added other length 
22.12.2018
Added buckle_blank.stp
18.12.2018
Added color modifier file (the one I used for the prints in the pics)
Added test print file
17.12.2018
Added snapp-on buckle, blank and with 3DW logo

Outlook:
-customizable buckle (I have to learn SCAD first though)
In the meantime you can use e.g. meshmixer to get your own logo on.
-customizable lenght (or additional  shorter and longer version)
-improve durability (make it 0,4mm thicker to get an extra layer at the front side)
-find answer to: how durable is it? by testing with weights until it snaps  
-more color modifyer
-add clearance at hinges


# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: i3 MK3 MMU 2
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: max 0.2
Infill: 15%
Filament_brand: Prusa
Filament_material: PETG or PLA

Notes: 
-print the test file first
-You need to set 4 perimeters so the hinges are strong enough.
-You'll get best results with PETG or PLA, ABS did not work for me.
-Also I tried to print it on an Ender 3 but it seems the printer does not work precisely enough and I ended up with welded together hinges.



# Post-Printing

After printing the belt might be a little "grispy" but with a few movements of each link it get's flexible and wearable.
